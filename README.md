# GitHub Actions CI/CD Course for Beginners

## What This Repository Is For

This is the student repository for a 2-day beginner-friendly CI/CD course.

We will follow one simple story through the whole course:

1. code
2. verify
3. package
4. deliver

## How to Use This Repository During Class

- Open the section for the part of the course we are in now.
- Early labs are browser-first. You do not need local Git to start.
- Change one thing at a time, especially in YAML files.
- If a workflow fails, read the logs before changing more files.

## Core versus Optional

During the main course, focus on Labs `01` to `05`.

For the core path, focus on these workflows:

- `01 Hello Workflow`
- `02 CI Workflow`
- `03 Build Artifact Workflow`
- `04 Deploy Workflow`

At the start of the course, focus on the four core workflows first.

Later in the course, some exercises will ask you to create new workflow files yourself.

Use this quick rule in the `Actions` tab:

- main path = the lab or exercise page your instructor is teaching now
- core workflows = `01`, `02`, `03`, `04`
- exercise workflows = create them yourself only when the matching exercise page asks you to do that
- optional path = workflows `05`, `06`, and later examples

## One Reminder

You do not need to memorize GitHub Actions syntax.

Keep returning to the main story:

1. code
2. verify
3. package
4. deliver

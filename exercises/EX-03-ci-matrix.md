# EX-03: CI Matrix

## Use This After

- [LAB-02: Real CI Workflow](../labs/LAB-02-real-ci-workflow.md)

## Goal

Run the same CI job on Python `3.11` and `3.12` without copying the whole job twice.

## Build

Create this workflow file yourself:

`.github/workflows/02-ci-matrix-exercise.yml`

Reference solution: instructor repo only.

## Requirements

- Create a CI workflow in `.github/workflows/02-ci-matrix-exercise.yml`.
- Keep the same CI story from Lab 02.
- Use a matrix so the job runs for Python `3.11` and `3.12`.
- Do not copy the whole job twice.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The Actions view shows one CI run for Python `3.11`.
- The Actions view shows one CI run for Python `3.12`.
- The workflow keeps the same job shape instead of duplicating the whole job.
- You can explain what repeated and what stayed the same.

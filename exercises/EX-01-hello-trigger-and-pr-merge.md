# EX-01: Hello Trigger and PR Merge

## Use This After

- [LAB-01: First Workflow](../labs/LAB-01-first-workflow.md)

## Goal

Take the tiny hello workflow and change the trigger story.

Instead of reacting to a simple direct change, make it react to a pull request being merged into `main`.

## Build

Create this workflow file yourself:

`.github/workflows/01-hello-exercise.yml`

Reference solution: instructor repo only.

## Requirements

- Create a very small workflow in `.github/workflows/01-hello-exercise.yml`.
- The workflow should react to pull requests that target `main`.
- The workflow should clearly distinguish between a pull request that was only closed and a pull request that was really merged.
- The workflow should still include `workflow_dispatch` so it can be started safely during class.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The workflow starts for the correct pull request event against `main`.
- The workflow does not treat every closed pull request as a merged pull request.
- You can explain why this trigger is different from Lab 01.
- You can explain why `workflow_dispatch` is still useful here.

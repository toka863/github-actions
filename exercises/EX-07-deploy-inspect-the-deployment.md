# EX-07: Deploy and Inspect the Deployment

## Use This After

- [LAB-04: Deploy Workflow](../labs/LAB-04-deploy-workflow.md)

## Goal

Keep the same deployment flow from Lab 04, but add a little more visibility after startup.

## Build

Create this workflow file yourself:

`.github/workflows/04-deploy-exercise.yml`

Reference solution: instructor repo only.

## Requirements

- Create a deploy workflow in `.github/workflows/04-deploy-exercise.yml`.
- Keep the same build-triggered deploy flow from Lab 04.
- Keep using the saved artifact from the build run.
- After startup, show the running containers with `docker ps`.
- After startup, print the `/health` response body.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The workflow still uses the same saved package from the build run.
- The logs show the running container list after startup.
- The logs show the `/health` response body.
- You can explain why this is still the same deploy story, not a new deployment system.
